__Warning__: Under active development. APIs may change. Lot of trailing development code around.

Train minecraft agents using reinforcement learning

## Dependencies

- <https://github.com/louis030195/gym.js> (until merged).
- Various tools from <https://github.com/PrismarineJS> for Minecraft stuff.
- <https://www.tensorflow.org/js> for deep learning (unfortunately tighted to a specific framework unlike in Python which has Numpy, but TFJS is great)

## Usage

```bash
examples/train.sh treeChop
```

# TODO

- Could be nice to make it possible to run prismarine-gym in a background process while playing to minecraft, learning the policy (and building a dataset) of the human player. Then you tell many Minecraft players "launch this thing" with a noob-friendly tuto = gather data !
